h2. What this is

This repo is just a collection of small addons that I use regularly in my MooTools projects, things like adding shuffling capability to Arrays to just convenience methods that can make code more readable.

I will try to keep this document up to date with addons that are in this repo and I will keep the source file updated commenting the usage of the addons.

If there are any addons that you find yourself using often in your project please fell free to fork this project and contribute what you can.
