MooTools Addons
===============

Description
-----------

This repo is just a collection of small addons that I use regularly in my MooTools projects, things like adding shuffling capability to Arrays to just convenience methods that can make code more readable.

I have the source code separated into separate files depending on the Class they extend, I will also keep a YUI compressed version of the all the addons in the Source directory.

I will try to keep this document up to date with addons that are in this repo and I will keep the source file updated commenting the usage of the addons.

How to use
----------

Just include the needed files on your site and start using the methods.
